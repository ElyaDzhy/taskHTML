                In this video, we're going to answer the question. What is a <b>chunk</b>?
            When you first look at a brand new concept it sometimes doesn't make much sense, 
            as shown by the jumbled puzzle pieces here. Chunking is the mental leap that helps 
            you unite bits of information together through meaning. The new logical whole makes 
            the chunk easier to remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger 
            picture of what you're learning. Just memorizing a fact without understanding or context 
            doesn't help you understand what's really going on or how the concept fits together with 
            other concepts you're learning. Notice there are no interlocking puzzle edges on the 
            puzzle piece to help you fit it to other pieces.
